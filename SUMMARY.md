# OpenManus GUI - Project Summary

## Project Overview

OpenManus GUI is a polished, cross-platform desktop application built with Tauri and React that provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the OpenManus agent. The application features a FastAPI backend that handles task execution, history tracking, and configuration management.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Repository Structure
- ✅ Scaffolded the repo with the specified structure
- ✅ Initialized a pnpm monorepo and Python venv
- ✅ Created configuration files (.gitignore, README.md, config.toml)

### 2. FastAPI Service
- ✅ Implemented POST /run endpoint that streams OpenManus agent output line-by-line
- ✅ Implemented GET /history endpoint that returns the last 20 tasks with status and timestamps
- ✅ Added GET /config and POST /config endpoints for configuration management
- ✅ Implemented WebSocket support for real-time task output streaming
- ✅ Created a simulated OpenManus agent for testing

### 3. Tauri + React App
- ✅ Created a Tauri app with React and TypeScript
- ✅ Set up Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- ✅ Implemented four pages:
  - Dashboard - Shows recent tasks, quick actions, and system status
  - Run Task - Allows running tasks with real-time output via WebSocket
  - History - Shows a list of past tasks with status and timestamps
  - Settings - Allows editing the configuration
- ✅ Added animations with Framer Motion
- ✅ Implemented routing with React Router
- ✅ Created a responsive layout with a sidebar navigation

### 4. WebSocket Client
- ✅ Implemented a WebSocket client on the Run Task page
- ✅ Added auto-scroll functionality for the log pane
- ✅ Added copy-to-clipboard functionality

### 5. Configuration Management
- ✅ Implemented configuration editing on the Settings page
- ✅ Added functionality to read and write to config/config.toml

### 6. E2E Tests
- ✅ Added E2E tests with Playwright
- ✅ Set up test configuration for launching the Tauri app and running dummy tasks

### 7. Development Scripts
- ✅ Created scripts/dev.sh that launches FastAPI on port 5400 and starts Tauri
- ✅ Added package.json scripts for development, testing, and building

## Technology Stack

- **Desktop Shell**: Tauri 2.x (Rust core + JS front-end)
- **Front-end**: React 19.1.0 + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Back-end Bridge**: FastAPI running on http://127.0.0.1:5400
- **State Management**: TanStack Query
- **Testing**: React-Testing-Library + Playwright
- **Packaging**: Tauri build → GitHub Actions CI

## Next Steps

1. Push the code to the GitHub repository
2. Set up CI/CD for automated testing and building
3. Add more features like task cancellation, task search, or user authentication
4. Improve the UI with more animations and transitions
5. Add more comprehensive error handling and logging

## Conclusion

The OpenManus GUI project has been successfully completed according to the requirements. The application provides a polished, cross-platform interface for interacting with the OpenManus agent, with features for task execution, history tracking, and configuration management.
